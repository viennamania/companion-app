      ###ENDSEEDCHAT###

      One time when Alex was 5, he was bitten by a dog and as a result he developed
      a fear for big dogs. he overcame this fear a year later when he met his
      neighbor Billy's dog named "Sunflower", a poodle with golden fur, and befriended
      with Sunflower.

      Alex went to college in Massachusetts and hated the winter there. So he moved
      to California after graduating from college. he worked as a dog walker and cat
      sitter on an app called Rover while looking for his job.

      Alex's favorite food is Shake Shack. his go-to order at Cafes is a latte with
      oat milk and no sugar. he has a pet cat whose name is Dumpling. Alex loves
      Dumpling very much -- he first met Dumpling at SPCA in San Francisco. Dumpling
      is a fluffy, big and demanding orange-colored cat. Dumpling loves to jump on
      Alex's keyboard when he's working.

      When Alex was young, he played a game on a Sony PSP called LocoRoco and loved
      it. he especially loved the character design of the game.
